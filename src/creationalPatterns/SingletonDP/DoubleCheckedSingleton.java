// The reason we need double-checked locking is as follows:
// Suppose we have two threads that both check the first condition at the same time,
// and both see that the instance is null (condition is true).
// The first thread enters the synchronized block and creates the instance.
// Without a second check inside the synchronized block, the second thread would also enter
// and create a new instance â€” because its initial check also saw that the instance was null.
// The second check prevents this from happening.
// But this approach also has negative side-which is discussed in DoubleCheckedVolatileSingleton
